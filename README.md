# NodeCP
NodeCP is a NodeJS Webhosting panel, allowing the easy setup of NodeJS-hosted websites on your machine using Nginx vhosts

# To-do / proposed features
- Administrator / user accounts
- Server plans (disk usage, bandwidth usage)
- Automatic creation of NGINX config, mail config (?), unix user, set quotas
- Do bandwidth monitoring (not sure on how to do this, check all active ports and their process, then get the owner of the process)
- Assign port for network usage
- Allow customisation of nginx static file serving (which files should be proxied to NodeJS, which shouldn't)
